Omnisearch can index PDFs, images, and some Microsoft Office documents with the help of [Text Extractor](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor). You can install this plugin, and enable the relevant settings.

Keep in mind that extracting text from those files is not guaranteed. At the time of writing, many PDFs don't work with Text Extractor.
